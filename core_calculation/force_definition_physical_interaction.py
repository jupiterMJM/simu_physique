"""
some forces cannot be simply explained by just a function but need a more complex physical description
for example, a spring force depends on the position of two bodies and the spring constant
Plus we do not want to "link" the spring at all the bodies but only at two (or None)
That's is why we create the following class to define such complex forces.

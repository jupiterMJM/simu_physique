# Physical simulation
We aim to provide an easy-to-use solution to simulate whatever one want in whatever situation we want.
For now, this file readme.md is not written to be user-aimed, but developer-aimed (aka me to remember what am I writting)

## Notes for myself
- for now, a body is only defined as a point, this will provide a simple MVP but it will have to be improved later
- units are those of international system

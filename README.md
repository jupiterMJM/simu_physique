# Physical simulation
We aim to provide an easy-to-use solution to simulate whatever one want in whatever situation we want.
For now, this file readme.md is not written to be user-aimed, but developer-aimed (aka me to remember what am I writting)

## Notes for myself
- for now, a body is only defined as a point, this will provide a simple MVP but it will have to be improved later
- units are those of international system
- we place ourselves in 3D in cartesian space (Earth's curvature not considered, for now at least); the basis
    will be (with your right hand, palm of the hand upwards), vect(x) is the inch, vect(y) is the index, vect(z) is the annular)
